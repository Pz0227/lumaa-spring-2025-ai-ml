# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation

**Deadline**: Sunday, Feb 23th 11:59 pm PST

---

## Overview

The current program is a **content-based movie recommendation system** that, given a **short text description** in **English** of a user’s preferences, suggests top 5 **similar items** from a small dataset which has 100 movies. The system uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to compare the user's query with movie overviews and return the most relevant recommendations.

---

1. **About Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project is **Top 100 Movies Dataset** from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls053251213/). The dataset contains information about movies including their genres, which will be used for similarity comparison.

2. **Approach**  
- ***Load the dataset*** - Read the movie data from a CSV file.
- ***Preprocess the text*** - Clean movie descriptions by converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, tokenize words, and remove stopwords.
- ***Convert text into numerical vectors*** - Use TF-IDF to transform text descriptions into numerical format.
- ***Compute similarity and Return top 5 recommendations*** - Calculate cosine similarity between the user query and all movie descriptions, and retrieve the most relevant movie titles.

3. **Setup Instruction**  
- Since this project is programed using Jupyter Notebook ```(.ipynb)```, install the required libraries directly using the following command:

```pip install jupyterlab```

- Open Jupyter Notebook.
- Load and run all cells sequentially.
- Enter a user input query about movie preference when prompted.

5. **Demonstrating video** 

Here is a short [video demo](https://youtu.be/0F_FnaNtMWQ) of how to run the program. 

6. **Example Output**

When given an input description (e.g., `"I like horror movie"`)

System will print or return a list of top 5 recommended movies with links:

 ['Dawn of the Dead'](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363547/)
 
 ['Tucker and Dale vs Evil']('https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1465522/)
 
 ['Shaun of the Dead']('https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/')
 
 ['Insidious']('https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591095/)
 
 ['The Mothman Prophecies']('https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265349/)


7. **Salary Expectation Per Hour**
15-30$/hr for the internship.
